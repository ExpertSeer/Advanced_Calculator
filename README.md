Advanced Calculator is a versatile application built in C# that combines multiple functionalities for mathematical and utility operations. This project is designed for users who need a comprehensive tool for calculations and number system conversions.

Features:

→ Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

→ Nth Root and Power Calculation: Compute the nth root of any number or raise a number to the nth power.

→ ASCII Value Finder: Retrieve the ASCII value of any input character.

→ Number System Conversions:
 -Convert between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal systems.
 -Supports both conversions (e.g., Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary).

Technology Used:

→ C# for development.

→ Visual Studio as the IDE.

→ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for a clean and modular structure.
