# Advanced Calculator
Advanced Calculator is a versatile application built in C# that combines multiple functionalities for mathematical and utility operations. This project is designed for users who need a comprehensive tool for calculations and number system conversions.

# Features:

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

2. Nth Root and Power Calculation: Compute the nth root of any number or raise a number to the nth power.

3. ASCII Value Finder: Retrieve the ASCII value of any input character.

4. Number System Conversions:
 - Convert between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal systems.
 - Supports both conversions (e.g., Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary).

# Technology Used:

→ C# for development.

→ Visual Studio as the IDE.

→ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for a clean and modular structure.

# Why This Project?

The Advanced Calculator project was created to explore C#'s capabilities while building a practical tool that can be used in day-to-day scenarios. It demonstrates efficient algorithm design, mathematical operations, and data conversion techniques.
